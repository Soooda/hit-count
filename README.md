# hit-count package

Provide (graphic **hopefully**) feedback towards the number of keyboard hits to motivate your programming experience

### Installation
The package can be installed using Atom:
* (For Windows) Click File - Settings - Install - Search hit-count - Click 'Install'
* (For MacOS) Click Atom - Preferences... - Install - Search hit-count - Click 'Install'
* Alternatively, you can use `apm`:
```
apm install hit-count
```

### Features
Have you ever played Devil May Cry(DMC)? What do ya think of the style ranking system?
This package provides similar functionality to rank your style. But of course, you are not
kicking devils' arse anymore. Instead, it will **rank your style of wrecking your keyboard**. :smirk:

You will receive a letter grade AS LONG AS you pound your lovely mechanical keyboard **constantly**,
and just like DMC, your rank will rise to SSS! YEET!

Levels range through the following:
* D - **D**ismal.
* C - **C**razy.
* B - **B**adass.
* A - **A**pocalyptic.
* S - **S**avage.
* SS - **S**ick **S**kills.
* SSS - **S**mokin' **S**exy **S**tyle.

At the end, my aim is to recreate the animation exactly the same as DMC in Atom. But yea, probably it is not
to late for me to start reading how to write HELLO WORLD in Javascript. :yum:
