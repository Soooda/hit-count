### Features
Have you ever played Devil May Cry(DMC)? What do ya think of the style ranking system?
This package provides similar functionality to rank your style. But of course, you are not
kicking devils' arse anymore. Instead, it will rank your style of wrecking your keyboard. :smirk:

You will receive a letter grade as long as you are pounding your lovely mechanical keyboard **constantly**,
and just like DMC, your rank will rise to SSS! YEET!

Levels range through the following:
>>D - Dismal.
>>C - Crazy.
>>B - Badass.
>>A - Apocalyptic.
>>S - Savage.
>>SS - Sick skills.
>>SSS - smokin' sexy style.
